Each player contributes to the success of the team, so understanding and trusting your teammates is crucial.

With so many players on a team, the level of coordination and collaboration has to be strong.

Just like being a part of a football team, being a part of an office team requires the same kind of collaboration.

As with football, youll likely experience high points and low points and need to lean on your team for support and motivation along the way.

Football has taught me many of these valuable skills, and they easily translate to team collaboration off the field

A football coach has a great responsibility to the team.

Not only are coaches invested in the success of the team as a whole, but they also aim to motivate each individual player.

The coach has the duty of taking their many different players and creating a cohesive team that accomplishes whats needed.

Managers who observe a football coachs ability to create a thriving team can learn to do the same for their employees.

In addition to the coach being a strong leader, there is also a great deal of respect that the team has for their coach.
